So I think to build a stux net app, I need to find a way for sample_app to
gain all the message id's of other processes and then subscribe to them

After that I then need to figure out a way to where I 
can show this data. For now i think just send it to the output buffer
maybe like everytime sample comes in rotation is spits out 
everything on the buffer
